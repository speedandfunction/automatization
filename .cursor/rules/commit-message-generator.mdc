# Commit Message Generator

When asked to generate a commit message:

1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see what files were changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to examine the actual changes
3. Generate a commit message with this format:

```
<Title: One sentence up to 120 characters describing the main change>

- <Change 1>
- <Change 2>
- <Change 3>
...
```

## Rules

- Title should be clear, concise, and descriptive
- Use imperative mood for the title (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature") 
- Each bullet point should describe a specific change
- Be specific about what was changed
- No explanations or additional context needed
- No sign-off, no issue references unless explicitly requested

## Examples

```
Add user authentication to login page

- Create LoginForm component with email/password fields
- Implement form validation for login inputs
- Add authentication service with API integration
```

```
Fix pagination bug in product list

- Update page calculation logic in ProductList component
- Add error handling for API pagination responses
- Fix CSS for pagination controls on mobile view
```
