# FAQ & Troubleshooting

This section addresses common questions and provides solutions for typical issues encountered with the Weekly Financial Summary system.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### Q: What is a Target Unit (TU)?

**A:** A Target Unit is a specific project group that represents a client project, internal initiative, or resource allocation with defined scope, deliverables, and measurable outcomes. Each TU tracks time, costs, and revenue for financial analysis.

#### Q: How often are reports generated?

**A:** Reports are generated weekly as part of the automated workflow. The system processes data for the current reporting period and delivers results via Slack.

#### Q: Who receives the reports?

**A:** Reports are sent to designated Slack channels where project managers, financial analysts, and other stakeholders can access them. The specific channels depend on your organization's configuration.

#### Q: Can I access historical reports?

**A:** Yes, historical reports are available in the Slack channel history. You can search for previous reports by date or use Slack's search functionality to find specific Target Units or time periods.

### Financial Metrics Questions

#### Q: What's the difference between Revenue and Effective Revenue?

**A:**

- **Revenue**: Calculated based on project rates and hours worked (planned/expected income)
- **Effective Revenue**: Actual revenue from QuickBooks Online (real-world income)

The difference can indicate billing improvements, scope changes, or data quality issues.

#### Q: Why might Effective Revenue be different from calculated Revenue?

**A:** Several factors can cause differences:

- **Billing adjustments** or rate changes
- **Scope modifications** or change orders
- **Payment timing** differences
- **Data synchronization** delays between systems
- **Manual adjustments** in QuickBooks Online

#### Q: What does marginality mean?

**A:** Marginality is the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after covering direct costs (COGS). It's calculated as: (Margin √∑ Revenue) √ó 100%. Higher marginality indicates better profitability.

#### Q: How are performance categories determined?

**A:** Target Units are categorized by their marginality:

- üü¢ **High Performance**: 55%+ marginality
- üü° **Medium Performance**: 45-55% marginality
- üî¥ **Low Performance**: <45% marginality

### Data and Integration Questions

#### Q: Where does the system get its data?

**A:** The system integrates data from three primary sources:

- **Redmine**: Project management and time tracking data
- **MongoDB**: Employee and project rate history
- **QuickBooks Online**: Actual revenue and financial data

#### Q: What if some data is missing?

**A:** The system handles missing data gracefully:

- **Missing rates**: Defaults to 0 to prevent calculation errors
- **Missing time data**: Excludes from calculations
- **Missing QBO data**: Uses calculated revenue instead
- **Connection issues**: Retries with exponential backoff

#### Q: How accurate is the data?

**A:** The system prioritizes data accuracy through:

- **Real-time validation** of input data
- **Consistent calculation methodology**
- **Error handling** for edge cases
- **Data quality checks** before processing
