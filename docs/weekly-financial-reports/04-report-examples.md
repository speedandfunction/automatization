## 📋 Detailed Report Example

The detailed report provides specific financial metrics for each Target Unit. Here are examples from the high-performance category:

### Example 1: Altavia TU

```
Altavia TU:
• period: Q3
• contract type: n/a
• total hours: 111.8
• revenue: $8,940
• COGS: $2,327
• margin: $6,613
• marginality: 74%
• effective revenue: $14,073
• effective margin: $11,746
• effective marginality: 83% 🟢
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Excellent Performance**: 74% marginality indicates very high profitability
- **Strong Effective Performance**: 83% effective marginality shows even better real-world performance
- **Revenue vs. Effective Revenue**: $8,940 calculated vs. $14,073 actual shows significant billing improvement
- **Cost Efficiency**: Low COGS ($2,327) relative to revenue indicates efficient resource utilization

### Example 2: Apostrophe TU

```
Apostrophe TU:
• period: Q3
• contract type: n/a
• total hours: 105.5
• revenue: $5,132
• COGS: $2,195
• margin: $2,937
• marginality: 57%
• effective revenue: $10,179
• effective margin: $7,984
• effective marginality: 78% 🟢
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Good Performance**: 57% marginality is above the high-performance threshold
- **Excellent Effective Performance**: 78% effective marginality indicates strong real-world results
- **Revenue Improvement**: Effective revenue ($10,179) is nearly double calculated revenue ($5,132)

```

**Interpretation:**

- **Investigation Needed**: This Target Unit requires immediate attention to understand the revenue difference
- **Potential Issues**: Could indicate billing problems, scope changes, or data quality issues
