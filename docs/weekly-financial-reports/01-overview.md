# System Overview

## What is the Weekly Financial Summary System?

The Weekly Financial Summary system is an automated workflow that generates comprehensive financial reports for Target Units (TUs) - specific project groups within your organization. The system processes data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights about project profitability and performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ System Purpose

### For Project Managers

The system helps you:

- **Monitor project profitability** in real-time
- **Identify performance trends** across different Target Units
- **Make data-driven decisions** about resource allocation
- **Track financial health** of ongoing projects

### For Financial Analysts

The system provides:

- **Automated financial calculations** with consistent methodology
- **Integration with multiple data sources** (Redmine, QuickBooks, MongoDB)
- **Standardized reporting format** for easy analysis
- **Historical data tracking** for trend analysis

## ðŸ”„ How the System Works

The Weekly Financial Summary workflow follows a structured process:

    style E fill:#f3e5f5
    style F fill:#e8f5e8
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Extraction**: The system retrieves Target Unit data from Redmine, including:

   - Project information and assignments
   - Time tracking data (hours worked)
   - User assignments and project relationships

2. **Financial Data Integration**: The system fetches additional data from:

   - **MongoDB**: Employee rates, project rates, and historical data
   - **QuickBooks Online**: Actual revenue data for effective calculations

3. **Calculation Engine**: The system performs complex financial calculations:

   - Revenue calculations based on project rates
   - Cost calculations based on employee rates
   - Margin and marginality calculations
   - Effective revenue and margin calculations

4. **Report Generation**: The system creates formatted reports with:

   - Color-coded performance indicators
   - Detailed financial breakdowns
   - Summary statistics and trends

5. **Delivery**: Reports are automatically sent to Slack channels for easy access and collaboration.

## ðŸ“Š Key Components

### Target Units (TUs)

Target Units are specific project groups that represent:

- **Client projects** with defined scopes and deliverables
- **Internal initiatives** with measurable outcomes
- **Resource allocations** with time and cost tracking

### Financial Metrics

The system calculates several key financial indicators:

| Metric                    | Description                                   | Business Impact                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Revenue**               | Project rate Ã— hours worked                   | Shows project income potential  |
| **COGS**                  | Employee rate Ã— hours worked                  | Represents actual project costs |
| **Margin**                | Revenue - COGS                                | Direct project profitability    |
| **Marginality**           | (Margin Ã· Revenue) Ã— 100%                     | Profitability percentage        |
| **Effective Revenue**     | Actual QBO revenue                            | Real-world income               |
| **Effective Margin**      | Effective Revenue - COGS                      | Actual profitability            |
| **Effective Marginality** | (Effective Margin Ã· Effective Revenue) Ã— 100% | Real profitability percentage   |

### Performance Categories

Target Units are categorized by their marginality performance:

- ðŸŸ¢ **High Performance** (55%+ marginality): Excellent profitability, maintain current approach
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Performance** (45-55% marginality): Good profitability, consider optimization opportunities
- ðŸ”´ **Low Performance** (<45% marginality): Needs immediate attention and improvement strategies

## ðŸŽ¨ Report Structure

### Summary Report

The main report provides a high-level overview:

- **Performance categorization** with color-coded indicators
- **Quick identification** of high and low performers
- **Overall system health** at a glance

### Detailed Report

The detailed report (in Slack thread) includes:

- **Individual Target Unit breakdowns** with specific metrics
- **Historical comparisons** and trend analysis
- **Actionable insights** for improvement

## ðŸ”§ System Architecture
